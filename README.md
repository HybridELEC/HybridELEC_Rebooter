# HybridELEC_Rebooter
Release-only repo for the HybridELEC Rebooter app used in Android+CE+EE firmware

There would've been sources here, but sadly I've lost the source of a lot of my old projects after an disk breakage. The sources would be opened here after a rewrite is finished, similarly to hepacker.

## Releases (newest first)
